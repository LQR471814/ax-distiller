Hate to read? No problem. **We can read the text to you**.

This feature is available **completely free**. While we will be keeping an eye on how feasible it is to eat the costs associated, we hope to keep it that way.

### All things start at the beginning

*   [Listen to this section](javascript:OpenAudioBookmark('summary'))
*   [Link to this section](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/1/summary)

Lesson 0 contains 4 pages, and goes over everything you need to know about:

*   what this course does and does not teach,
*   how we recommend going through it so as to get the most out of it,
*   and the various methods (cheap and free) that you can use to get feedback on your work.

This page in particular focuses on what the course covers, so you can better understand whether Drawabox is a good choice for what you're looking to learn.

**Read through the material and watch any videos as they come up** (like the one directly beneath this, with the greyed out thumbnail featuring a play icon on top). Only watching the videos or only doing the reading will cause you to miss information, and will make it less likely that you will fully absorb the information you encounter.

### What is Drawabox?

*   [Listen to this section](javascript:OpenAudioBookmark('whatis'))
*   [Link to this section](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/1/whatis)

Drawabox is, at its core, a community of people developing their drawing skills. Our members range from total beginners, to self-taught artists seeking more structured ways to practice, to established artists looking to sharpen their skills.

This community revolves around the free lessons I've written (and rewritten, and rewritten again), which were originally built upon the foundations of what I learned from **[Peter Han](https://instagram.com/peterhanstyle)'s Dynamic Sketching course** when I attended Concept Design Academy in 2013. Peter's own lessons build upon the work of his mentor, the late [Norm Schureman](http://normanschureman.com/home.php).

Dynamic Sketching had an enormous impact on me, and while I've chosen to narrow the focus of Drawabox to a very specific set of "core" fundamental concepts, I still believe Dynamic Sketching is an excellent course to take at *some* point - specifically because where Drawabox will teach you to make your drawings feel solid and three dimensional, Dynamic Sketching will teach you to make them look *really* cool.

You can take [Dynamic Sketching with Peter Han himself](https://drawabox.com/rec/han/dynamicsketching) (although this is quite expensive, due to it including feedback from the instructor).

Another, more affordable option is the [Dynamic Sketching video course with Charles Hu over on New Masters Academy](https://www.nma.art/courses/visual-development-dynamic-sketching/?ref=134), where it's included in their monthly subscription. Since they're our sponsor, you can also get 25% off your first billing cycle with them, **using our coupon code DRAWABOX**.

**Drawabox's goal is to provide beginners with a strong foundation, and to equip them with the things a lot of other courses and tutorials tend to take for granted**. We achieve this by treating drawing less as an academic pursuit focusing on memorization, and more like an athletic one. While concepts are certainly explained, they are hammered in through active drills and repetition.

Drawabox is a **very rigorous course**. Some students have completed it in as little as 5 months, while others have taken a year, or even two. What matters is that you give each exercise, and each drawing, as much time as it requires to be executed **to the best of your current ability**. Setting your own deadlines or expectations is *highly* discouraged - it'll cause you to rush, and to progress more slowly in the long run. Plenty of students come here with the intent to achieve something specific in a certain amount of time - if that is a necessity for you, then this course may not be the best choice.

It is not going to make you a professional on its own, but it will teach you **how to practice**, **how to use the resources available to you on the internet**, and **equip you with the tools and skills you need to take advantage of them**. Think of Drawabox as one big tutorial zone in a sandbox game; it'll take a while to get through it, but once you're done, you'll be ready to enter a world full of fun and interesting sources of instruction.

### What are the fundamentals?

*   [Listen to this section](javascript:OpenAudioBookmark('fundamentals'))
*   [Link to this section](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/1/fundamentals)

The answer to this question depends on who you ask - but what we cover here focuses on a specific subset of what others might call out when listing the fundamentals of drawing.

We call these the **core fundamentals of drawing** - the things you'll need to apply and learn everything else more effectively. These core fundamentals focus in three areas:

*   Confident and controlled **MARK MAKING** - the ability to make the marks you intend to make, and to keep them smooth and hesitation-free.
*   Attentive and fastidious **OBSERVATION**
*   And the big focus of this course overall: **SPATIAL REASONING** - the understanding deep in your brain that despite drawing on a flat page, the things you're producing exist in a real, three dimensional world. The page itself is merely a window looking out onto that world.

These are not *everything* there is to know, but they lay down a solid foundation upon which everything else can be built. For example, while we do not touch upon any lighting, rendering, or shading in this course, such concepts rely on understanding how different objects and surfaces might relate to a light source in the scene - which is what we develop by working on spatial reasoning.

As mentioned in the video above, while Drawabox focuses on a limited set of core concepts, you are still encouraged to explore any others that may be of interest to you. Doing so alongside what you learn here will help you develop into a more well-rounded artist.

Our sponsor, **[New Masters Academy](https://drawabox.com/nma)**, has a ton of material that explore other fundamentals of drawing. For example:

*   [Art Anatomy for Beginners with Steve Huston](https://drawabox.com/nma/artanatomybeginners)
    > Steve Huston explores the human body in a manner that lines up exceptionally well with the focus on form and spatial reasoning we explore here, making this analytical approach to figure drawing an excellent complement to our lessons. I've actually been on the hunt for years for an online course that follows the same methodology I learned from Kevin Chen years ago - and this fits the bill perfectly.
*   [Drawing with FORCE with Michael Mattesi](https://drawabox.com/nma/drawingwithforce)
    > Figure drawing is a marriage of two core concepts - structure and gesture. In this course, Michael Mattesi explores his unique, physics-based methodology for drawing bodies that move naturally and believably through the space in which they exist.
*   [Fundamentals of Observational Drawing with Iliya Mirochnik](https://drawabox.com/nma/fundamentalsofobservationaldrawing)
    > In this course, Iliya teaches a variety of observational drawing tools and techniques, with a focus on the Russian Drawing Approach - a distinct methodology that has remained largely unaltered in over two centuries. This course also includes two lessons dedicated to teaching the fundamentals of light and shadow, which will help you understand the basics of shading.
*   [Finding Your Voice as an Artist with Steve Huston and Bill Perkins](https://drawabox.com/nma/findingyourvoice)
    > This course by Steve Huston and Bill Perkins (of Little Mermaid and Aladdin fame) takes an analytical approach to breaking down the concepts of personal style, and helps students to find a guiding direction for their journey.

### How is Drawabox free?

*   [Listen to this section](javascript:OpenAudioBookmark('whyfree'))
*   [Link to this section](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/1/whyfree)

Drawabox is a business, but I am a strong believer that we can provide free resources, and cheap access to feedback, while still compensating our team well for their work.

We're able to do this while remaining viable as a business because of our credit-based pricing structure. Those who subscribe here through Patreon at any of the student tiers receive "credits" when they are charged, and those credits expire two months after their receipt. Those who can afford to allow some (and even all) of their credits to expire, allowing their contribution to go towards subsidizing the overall price for others, whereas those who have tighter budgets can maintain control by subscribing, cancelling, and re-subscribing as needed.

As we continue to grow, we are working towards constantly improving the lessons, applying what we've learned by explaining concepts in thousands of critiques to updates and rewrites of lesson content, and expanding more of the lesson critiques to our team of teaching assistants. In doing so, it will allow me to focus more on refining the material, and expanding what we're able to offer on the free side of things even further.

Along with the critiques we offer, and our smaller supporter-tier patrons, Drawabox is funded by:

*   Display advertisements on the website - although currently our generous sponsor, New Masters Academy, has purchased all of our advertising slots to provide you with a much cleaner, less distracting learning experience. Every student who signs up with [NMA](https://drawabox.com/nma) using our DRAWABOX coupon code both gets 25% off their first billing cycle *and* helps support Drawabox.
*   [Importing and selling fineliner pens](https://drawabox.com/shop/pens?lesson0.1) - this is primarily to provide the community with access to good quality fineliners at a far cheaper price (though we're only able to offer them with free shipping in the continental United States, so they're not necessarily as good of a deal internationally).
*   Affiliate link [recommendations](https://drawabox.com/recommendations) through Amazon, where we earn a small commission for any sales that use our links

**If you're unable to support us through Patreon**, consider shopping through our affiliate links, signing up for [New Masters Academy](https://drawabox.com/nma) using our DRAWABOX coupon code, or purchasing our pens when they are in stock.

*On the next page, let's look at just how a lot of students tend to think about drawing, what they are and aren't ready for, and what keeps holding them back.*

The recommendation below is an advertisement. Most of the links here are part of Amazon's affiliate program (unless otherwise stated), which helps support this website. It's also more than that - it's a hand-picked recommendation of something we've used ourselves, or know to be of impeccable quality. If you're interested, [here is a full list](https://drawabox.com/recommendations).

*   [Wescott Grid Ruler Image](https://d15v304a6xpq4b.cloudfront.net/lesson_images/ace83d1f.jpg) - [Wescott Grid Ruler ](https://amzn.to/3KZMtFM)
*   [Link to recommendations page](https://drawabox.com/recommendations/)

Every now and then I'll get someone asking me about which ruler I use in my videos. It's this Wescott grid ruler that I picked up ages ago. While having a transparent grid is useful for figuring out spacing and perpendicularity, it ultimately not something that you can't achieve with any old ruler (or a piece of paper you've folded into a hard edge). Might require a little more attention, a little more focus, but you don't need a fancy tool for this.

But hey, if you want one, who am I to stop you?
